ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Norwin Analysis Project is a comprehensive exploration of customer and transaction data with the goal of uncovering meaningful business insights. By analyzing patterns in customer behavior, purchasing trends, and sales performance, this project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into actionable intelligence that supports data-driven decision-making.

The analysis not only identifies key performance drivers but also highlights opportunities for customer retention, revenue optimization, and business growth.



### Dataset Description ###

The dataset used in this project includes multiple dimensions of customer and sales activity.

Key Features:
- CustomerID â€“ unique identifier for each customer.
- Demographics â€“ gender, age group, location (where available).
- Transaction Details â€“ invoice number, product purchased, quantity, and unit price.
- Date/Time Variables â€“ invoice date, purchase frequency, seasonal trends.
- Country/Region â€“ geographic distribution of transactions.




### Objectives of the Analysis ###
The analysis was designed to answer the following business questions:
Customer Behavior

- Who are the high-value customers?
- How do purchasing patterns differ across demographics or regions?
- Sales & Revenue Trends
- What products/services generate the most revenue?
- What seasonal or time-based patterns exist in sales activity?
- Retention & Loyalty
- What is the customer churn rate?
- Which segments are most at risk of attrition?
- Growth Opportunities
- Where can Norwin invest to maximize ROI?
- Which customer groups or regions have untapped potential?
